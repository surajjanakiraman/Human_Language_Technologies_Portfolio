Good ideas need spaces to take shape before they can take off. So we built Medium to make it easier for more people to read, write and explore ideas together. Thatâs why weâre an open platform 20,000 people use to share their expertise and experiences every day. Itâs also why weâre a publisher, creating the stories 150-million Medium readers are asking for. And why we work with well-known authors, magazines and newspapers to help more people find great thinking that expands their perspective.
A place to think,  âI never thought of that.â
Find writing from world-class publications and undiscovered voices that dive into the heart of the matterâno matter the topicâto bring new ideas to the surface.
