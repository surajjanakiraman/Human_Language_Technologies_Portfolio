Updated review!
A few weeks ago I left an unfavorable review highlighting a number of bugs and design issues with the Medium app. However, with a recent update it seems that many of the issues have been resolved! Just wanted to say thank you to the developers and everyone involved in listening to and applying my feedback. These changes really have made my experience better and the quick turnaround was also impressive. Thank you so much üôèüèª If I could make one last suggestion, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any direct way to give feedback or bug reports for this app outside of leaving a review on the App Store. I would‚Äôve happily sent an email with my feedback and given the devs a chance to fix them before leaving a poor review. It‚Äôs also just easier and more efficient to communicate that way if you need more info or screenshots or anything like that. Setting up such a feedback channel can help protect your illustrious App Store rating and keep the business folks happy. Cheers again for building a great app and a great community and for valuing your user‚Äôs feedback üëçüèª

The app asked for a review so here it is:
First off I love what Medium is doing here. From a consumer of interesting writing, this is exactly what I want; no ads and very often articles that are interesting to me. The articles surfaced are improving as I use the service which is a good sign that what these people are doing with my usage is working. The app on the other hand has some nagging issues for those who use an iPad in landscape or simply prefer landscape mode regardless of device. This app is clearly designed to be used in portrait mode... yes it works in landscape but the layout doesn't really fit the screen most of the time, and has huge white margins on both sides. It's as if the designers decided rather than reflow the text, we'll just keep the same text width and add huge margins on the sides. Large pictures that are embedded within articles tend to be cut off when in landscape, but are sized nicely to fit within the screen in portrait. Even worse, as of the last update the app shows a blank white screen when switching from portrait to landscape. I know that this may come off as a bit of a quibble, and it is, but a large iPad Pro just isn't very comfortable in portrait, and anything with videos really should be in landscape anyway. Besides, the app did pester me for a review, so here you go... All in all, a great service and an app that is more than usable, just not 5 starts great... yet.

Surprisingly, I like it. It crashes every time I use it more than five minutes, though
I've only been on Medium for two months. I was pleasantly surprised by the content. It wasn't all clickbait. I went to a Medium live writing session and the teacher was charming and funny. So I decided to stick around.  I have an iPhone 12 Pro and no internet issues. Not sure why Medium crashes like this. Maybe tracking? I don't know. That's why i didnt get a membership before. The site is built, be to track your reading and I didn't like that lack of privacy. However, some writers I loved were on it, which legitimized it. I need to find more writers of interest to follow. As much as I probably could use the "I made $$$ this month from writing here's how" articles and how relatable that journey was, I get resentful of clickbait titles and worse, the consistent typos on the especially clickbaity ones that manage to snag me. I am interested in productivity, etc, but it's hard to tease out what's real and what's just a content creator maximising his brand.  By the third click or so, the app freezes for me. I would love for this to change so I can see the direction Medium is growing. I think they mean well and have lofty aspirations. For me, not crashing would be a good start. Thanks.
